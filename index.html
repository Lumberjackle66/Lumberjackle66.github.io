									<h3>Immortals</h3>
									<p>The Immortals are by far the best team and will probably come first but everyone is looking ahead to worlds and wondering, "Do they have a chance?". Their surprising first loss to CLG means that "The Streak" has ended, especially for Huni and Reignover.</p>

									<h3>Team Vitality</h3>
									<p>Team Vitality are fighting with H2K and G2 Esports for the top spot in the EU LCS. They look like the strongest of the three but it is still very close. G2 Esports' playstyle is very different from H2K's and Team Vitality's. G2 Esports' playstyle consists of going all in and nonstop fighting. That usually results in very bloody matches.</p>

									<h3>ROX Tigers</h3>
									<p>The ROX Tigers Are Dominating The LCK And Are So Far Undeafeated. They prove to be stronger than SKT T1 by beating them in the best of 3. The reigning world champions aren't doing as well. SKT T1 have a score of 5 wins and 4 losses which is very bad for a team that has won the world championships 2 times. The ROX Tigers are doing quite the opposite and have their eyes set on the champions trophy.</p>

										<h3>Adrian "Adrian" Ma</h3>
										<p>Adrian "Adrian" Ma joined the Immortals after his stint with Team Impulse in the NA LCS. His precision with skill-shot based champions gave him enough recognition to earn a role on one of NA's new super teams sporting top-tier talent from the EU and NA LCS. Although his mechanics were fair enough to land him the job, it's his approach to the game that makes Adrian a valuable asset to the Immortals -- he's methodical, organized, and ready to save his teammates.

										<h3>Yeu-Jin "Reignover" Kim</h3>
										<p>Yeu-jin “Reignover” Kim balances trickery with brute force in the wild jungles of Summoner's Rift. After launching his esports career in 2013 as a part of the Korean team Incredible Miracle 2, Reignover moved to EU heavyweights Fnatic at the start of 2015. Reignover was instrumental in Fnatic’s climb to the top of the table in the 2015 EU LCS Spring Split. He then proceeded to outdo himself, helping the team achieve a flawless 18W-0L record in the 2015 EU LCS Summer Split. Reignover's hunger didn't stop there, and he sought out a new challenge at the end of 2015 by joining the freshly-minted NA team, the Immortals.

										<h3>Konstantinos "FORG1VENGRE" Tzortziou-Napoleon</h3>
										<p>Konstantinos “FORG1VENGRE” Tzortziou-Napoleon is one of the most intense AD carries in Europe. Scoring a phenomenal 12.3 KDA in the 2015 EU LCS Spring Split, FORG1VENGRE was almost untouchable on his preferred Graves and Lucian picks. After leaving SK Gaming in the wake of their poor performance in the 2015 EU LCS Spring Playoffs, FORG1VENGRE was briefly picked up by Gambit Gaming as their starting AD carry before he eventually made his way to H2K at the end of 2015.

										<h3>Pierre "Steelback" Medjaldi</h3>
										<p>Pierre “Steeelback” Medjaldi started his esports career wandering between organizations, but he rose to prominence with Fnatic. His first season with the EU giants was a fast and furious run to the top of the heap, culminating in Fnatic clinching 1st place in the 2015 EU LCS Spring Playoffs. Steeelback earned an 8.9 KDA along the way, routinely wrecking the opposition. However, Steeelback was moved to the bench prior to the start of the 2015 EU LCS Summer Split, making way for Fnatic's old favorite Rekkles. He eventually found his way back to the EU LCS with the Unicorns of Love. Steeelback and Hylissang will be working hard to turn the UOL bot lane into a carry threat during the 2016 EU LCS.
